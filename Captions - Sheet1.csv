For a second I was almost jealous of the clouds.
The sun always shines above the clouds.
"Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky."
Behind every cloud is another cloud.
Clouds suit my mood just fine.
"If you use your imagination, you can see lots of things in the cloud formations."
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.
There's a bright spot in every dark cloud.
There are no rules of architecture for a castle in the clouds.
"We all have bad days, but one thing is true; no cloud is so dark that the sun can't shine through."
You must not blame me if I do talk to the clouds.
"When we feel stuck, look at the sky. The clouds remind us that everything changes."
Life is good at the beach
Let the countdown to the Beach begin
Life is better at the Beach
Beach days always
Love you to the beach and back.
The best days are Beach days.
Beach More Worry Less
Beach life is sheared perfect.
Beach therapy should be covered by health insurance
The mountains are calling and I must go
It isn’t the mountain ahead that wears you out; it’s the grain of sand in your shoe
Mountains teach that not everything in this world can be rationally explained
Every man should pull a boat over a mountain once in his life
"I have loved her, my little wanderer, with a mind full of wild forests and eyes that await adventures"
"In the mountains there are only two grades: You can either do it, or you can’t."
The mountain remains unmoved at seeming defeat by the mist
"It’s not the Mountain we conquer, but ourselves."
Mountains have a way of dealing with overconfidence.
"I’ve realised that at the top of the mountain, there’s another mountain"
"For me, a holiday is about taking a book and going to a mountain and reading."
I can’t understand why men make all this fuss about Everest — it’s only a mountain
"A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad"
The dog is the perfect portrait subject. He doesn't pose. He isn't aware of the camera
"No matter how you're feeling, a little dog gunna love you"
The love of a dog is a pure thing. He gives you a trust which is total. You must not betray it.
"Money can buy you a fine dog, but only love can make him wag his tail."
You can tell by the kindness of a dog how a human should be.
Dog is God spelled backward
"Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read."
Water is Your Best Friend for Life
"Thousands Have Lived Without Love, Not One Without Water"
Water is Your Best Friend for Life
Time spent with cats is never wasted
I've always been mad about cats.
I love my cats more than I love most people. Probably more than is healthy.
"Cats are inquisitive, but hate to admit it."
I love cats.
I take care of my flowers and my cats. And enjoy food. And that's living.
"If kisses were snowflakes, I'd send you a blizzard."
Be like snow: beautiful but cold.
"If you listen carefully, the silence of snow falling is beautiful."
I love you snow much.
"Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"
"When it snows, you have two choices: shovel or make snow angels"
Winter is coming
Discover the beauty of winter
Hello Winter
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Bikes bring you places cars never see.
Life is better on a bike.
"Bike to work, bike to play, bike tomorrow, bike today"
"Life is like riding a bike. To keep your balance, you must keep moving"
"When the flowers start blooming, I like to ride my bike"
I won't quit skating until I am physically unable.
"I love skating and sparkling and flying around the ice, and people clap for you. It's an amazing feeling."
"I love skating. It's part of my life, and I never wanted to give it up."
Beautiful things don’t ask for attention
The earth has music for those who listen
Nature is not a place to visit it is home
Every sunset brings the promise of a new dawn
Every sunset is an opportunity to reset
You are not in the mountains. The mountains are in you.
Nature never goes out of style
Choose only one master – NATURE
Nature itself is the best physician
"If sky is the limit, then go there"
Say yes to new adventures
Let’s sleep under the STARS
"Don’t go through life, grow through life"
On the top of mountains & beneath the stars
The only thing I like better than talking about Food is eating
Food is really and truly the most effective medicine.
I get way too much happiness from good food.
"If you combine good flavors, food turns into an orchestra"
Cheese – milk’s leap towards immortality.
Count the memories not the calories.
Food is an important part of a balanced diet.
There is no sincere love than the love of food.
Romaine calm and go plant a garden!
The best things in life are green
hey say gardens are dishes best served green.
I can totally see why they say it's best to go with the flowers
We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.
"Good buildings come from good people, and all problems are solved by good design."
"Buildings, too, are children of Earth and Sun."
Recycling old buildings to show art is very important
You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else.
Life is a game and true love is a trophy.
"Go for great. Own your game. Be kind. Get big things done.
"
"To me, cricket is a simple game. Keep it simple and just go out and play."
"Mathematics is a game played according to certain simple rules with meaningless marks on paper.
"
Nobody cares if you can’t dance well. Just get up and dance
"When you dance, your purpose is not to get to a certain place on the floor. It’s to enjoy each step along the way"
"Great dancers are not great because of their technique, they are great because of their passion"
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love.
"here are shortcuts to happiness, and dancing is one of them."
"Dancing faces you towards Heaven, whichever direction you turn"
"You can dance anywhere, even if only in your heart."
Singing is one of the most organic forms of humanity
"If I cannot fly, Let me sing."
"God respects me when I work, but he loves me when I sing."
Singing is a natural outgrowth of time spent in revelry.
"If everyone started off the day singing, just think how happy they'd be."
"Because of your smile, you make life more beautiful."
"Whatever comes in my way, I take it with smile"
"Nothing beats a great smile
"
"Show me a smile, and I'll show you one back."
"I truly believe my job is to make sure people smile
"
"Don’t talk, just act. Don’t say, just show. Don’t promise, just prove."
Do whatever makes you happiest
"Having the dream is easy, making it come true is hard"
You can regret a lot of things but you’ll never regret being kind
The impossible is now possible
Hold onto your best friend because you’ll never find someone like them again
A smile can change the world
Life is tough but so am I
The little things in life matter
It may be stormy now but it never rains forever
Act like you own the world because you do
Work. Save. Travel. Repeat.
Time for an adventure
Go to the place where you feel most alive
Sometimes all the soul needs is a walk in nature
Life is short and the world is wide so get out there and explore it
Sometimes all the soul needs is a walk in nature
The mountains call to me
Give second chances but not for the same mistake
I may be down to earth but I’m still above you
"Don’t be average, be savage"
Don’t judge someone by their mistakes but on how they fix them
"People will judge everything you do, so you do you"
I just rolled my eyes so hard I saw my brain
It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas
"I’m dreaming of a white Christmas. But if the white runs out, pour me some red."
"Happy New Year, everyone!"
"Cheers to a new year of love, happiness and success"
Happy birthday to me
"Gonna party like my birthday… oh wait, it is"
Having my cake and eating it too
"Go shawty, it’s my birthday"
Creating a life I love
Filling my mind with happy thoughts
Sleep like no one’s watching
Hitting the books today
Let’s get the party started
She acts like summer and walks like rain.
"Be yourself, there’s no one better."
Never let anyone treat you like you’re ordinary.
Self-love is the best love.
Some days you just have to create your own sunshine.
"Morning coffee, because anything else is worthless."
"Fresh out of the shower, no makeup on."
"You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough."
My heart is so full
You’re never too old to be young
Beauty never asks for Attention.
Never underestimate the power of good attire on a bad day.
My personality is sassy and cheeky.
